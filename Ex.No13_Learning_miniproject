### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for heart disease..
###  Algorithm:
Step 1- Collect a dataset with features and labels.
Step 2- Data Preprocessing like handle missing values and split datas for feature scaling.
Step 3- Choose a suitable machine learning model logistic regression
Step 4- Train the selected model on the training dataset
Step 5- Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset
Step 6- Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance like random search or grid search.
Step 7- Deploy the model for real world predictions.

### Program:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# loading the csv data to a Pandas DataFrame
heart_data = pd.read_csv('/content/data.csv')

# print first 5 rows of the dataset
heart_data.head()







### Output:


### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
